Hello! My name is Siegfried. I currently study at Brooklyn College for my undergraduate degree for Computer Science and Data Science. I am currently striding to break into the sports entertainment industry. Recently, I was able to make my first steps towards that goal by working closely with the father of famed former NBA player, Metta Artest. 
I worked with his non-profit company by assisting the outreach team with their search for clients and prospective sponsors through data scraping. In between my lectures and exams, I do photography for the entertainment industry and news journalism. For the entertainment industry, I mainly shoot numerous red carpets for movie/show premieres and fashion shows. On the news journalism side, I shoot events that range from a grand opening of the new Microsoft Garage in New York City, to various press meetings held by political figures. You can take a look at some of my photos for the [Associated Press, here](https://newsroom.ap.org/editorial-photos-videos/search?query=siegfried%20nacion&mediaType=photo&st=keyword).
 

I look forward to working with a team looking to gain a member who is hungry for more knowledge and experiences! Check out some of my projects [here](https://siegfriedanthony.github.io/projects/).
