Hello! My name is Siegfried. I currently study over at Brooklyn College for my undergraduate degree for Computer Science and Data Science. I am currently striding to break into the sports entertainment industry. Recently, I was able to make my first steps towards that goal by working closely with the father of famed former NBA player, Metta Artest. 
I helped his non-profit company, [The Artest Foundation](https://www.theartestfoundation.org), through improving their website and assisting the outreach team with their search for clients and prospective sponsors. In my free time, I am a freelance photographer who specializes in shooting red carpet venue events such as the Met Gala and the VMA's!

I look forward to working with a team looking to gain a member who is hungry for more knowledge and experiences!
